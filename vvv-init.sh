# Add GitHub and GitLab to known_hosts, so we don't get prompted
# to verify the server fingerprint.
# The fingerprints in [this repo]/ssh/known_hosts are generated as follows:
#
# As the starting point for the ssh-keyscan tool, create an ASCII file 
# containing all the hosts from which you will create the known hosts 
# file, e.g. sshhosts.
# Each line of this file states the name of a host (alias name or TCP/IP 
# address) and must be terminated with a carriage return line feed 
# (Shift + Enter), e.g.
# 
# bitbucket.org
# github.com
# gitlab.com
# 
# Execute ssh-keyscan with the following parameters to generate the file:
# 
# ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa -f ssh_hosts >ssh/known_hosts
# The parameter -t rsa,dsa defines the hostâ€™s key type as either rsa 
# or dsa.
# The parameter -f /home/user/ssh_hosts states the path of the source 
# file ssh_hosts, from which the host names are read.
# The parameter >ssh/known_hosts states the output path of the 
# known_host file to be created.
#
